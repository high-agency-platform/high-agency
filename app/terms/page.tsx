        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p className="legal__meta">Effective {EFFECTIVE}</p>

        <p>
          These are the rules for using high-agency.io and the High Agency platform. By
          applying, creating an account, or joining a session you agree to them. Questions go
          to <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT}`}>{CONTACT}</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Who can use it</h2>
        <p>
          The program is for students aged 13 to 19. Invited members verify their email
          and complete a profile to take part; a parent approval email is not an access
          requirement. Mentors are adults invited by High Agency.
        </p>

        <h2>Your account</h2>
        <p>
          Keep your sign-in link private and tell us if you think someone else has used your
          account. You are responsible for what is posted from it.
        </p>

        <h2>How to behave</h2>
        <p>
          Be honest about what you have built and what you have done. Treat other members, your
          mentor, and everyone in a session with respect. Do not post anything illegal,
          hateful, or intended to harm someone, and do not share other members&apos; personal
          details. We may remove content or close accounts that break these rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Your work</h2>
        <p>
          What you build is yours. By posting on the platform you let High Agency show that
          content to your squad, your mentor, and staff so the program can run. If we want to
          feature your work publicly, we will ask you first.
        </p>

        <h2>Sessions</h2>
        <p>
          Workshops and check-ins run on Google Meet. Seats are limited; if you enroll and
          cannot make it, give the seat back so someone else can use it.
        </p>

        <h2>The service</h2>
        <p>
          High Agency is provided as is. We work hard to keep it running, but we cannot promise
          it will always be available or error-free, and we are not liable for losses that
          come from relying on it beyond what the law requires.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms. If a change matters, we will tell members by email and
          update the date above.
