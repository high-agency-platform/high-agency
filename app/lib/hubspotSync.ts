/**
 * The sync engine. Server-only, Admin SDK, bypasses security rules.
 *
 * Direction 1 — Firebase → HubSpot (push): every application and every
 * approved member becomes a Contact with its full application on the record,
 * so staff can read, segment and mail from one place.
 *
 * Direction 2 — HubSpot → Firebase (pull): staff sets `ha_application_status`
 * to Approved or Declined on the contact, and the next sync applies it — an
 * approval writes the founding-batch allowlist entry that actually lets that
 * person get an account. This direction is POLL-based, not webhook-based, on
 * purpose: the portal is on a tier with no workflow webhook actions, so there
 * is nothing to subscribe to. `ha_decision_synced` is the marker that stops a
 * decision being applied twice.
 *
 * Everything here is idempotent and independently failing: one bad record
 * collects an error and the run continues. `reconcile()` is safe to call as
 * often as you like.
 *
 * If HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN is unset every entry point returns a "skipped"
 * summary instead of throwing. We do not have a portal token yet.

 * 0 forever and be worse than useless. But a naive "re-push everyone on every
 * tick" is dozens of HubSpot writes every five minutes for a number that
 * changes a handful of times a week.
 *
 * The candidate set is the load-bearing decision. It comes from `applications`,
 * NOT from `referrals`:
 *
 *   `referrals` is a PUBLIC, unauthenticated-writable collection — the waitlist
 *   has to be able to mint and credit counters for signed-out visitors. So
 *   anyone can create counters with `confirmed > 0`. A bounded query over that
 *   collection (`where confirmed > 0` + `limit`) applies its limit BEFORE any
 *   ownership filtering, and Firestore's ordering is stable, so a cheap flood
 *   of ownerless counters would occupy the first page forever and real
 *   applicants' counts would never be refreshed again. That is starvation by
 *   anyone with a browser, and no cursor fixes it — the flood outnumbers the
 *   real rows on every page.
 *
 *   Applications are create-only, carry the applicant's own minted code, and
 *   are stamped with `hubspotContactId` by the Admin SDK. Driving from them
 *   means an ownerless counter is never even a candidate: it has no application
 *   pointing at it, so it is never read and never considered.
 *
 * The rest is unchanged and still cheap:
 *
 *   1. Take the applications that have a code AND have been pushed. Counters
 *      are then read BY ID, batched — never queried, so nothing a stranger
 *      writes can affect which ones we look at.
 *   2. Compare against REFERRAL_MIRROR_FIELD — what we last told HubSpot. Equal
 *      means no API call at all. This is the change detection that makes the
 *      five-minute cadence safe.
 *   3. Only then patch the contact, and record the new value in the same shape
 *      so the next pass sees it as unchanged. Bounded by
 *      REFERRAL_REFRESH_MAX_WRITES per pass.
 *
 * Staff counters are skipped: they are nobody's application, so they never
 * appear as candidates, and the one that could (a staff code someone also typed
 * onto an application) is filtered by `kind`. Staff totals are answerable in
 * HubSpot by filtering contacts on `ha_referred_by` = the staff code, which is
 * a better number anyway — it is the list of people, not just the count.
 *
 * Idempotent, and safe to run concurrently with itself: every write is a
 * value-equality-guarded upsert keyed on a stable id.
