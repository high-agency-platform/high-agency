/**
 * "You're in" email for a newly approved applicant. Server-only.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THAT IS THE POINT. These are real 13–18 year olds, and
 * an approval flipped in a CRM should not be able to mail a minor before a
 * human has decided that is what happens. Nothing is sent unless
 * HUBSPOT_APPROVAL_EMAIL is exactly "on"; the default return is "off".
 *
 * Transport is the same Resend posture as consentEmail/accessEmail: when
 * RESEND_API_KEY is missing the message is logged instead, so the flow is
 * exercisable locally without a provider secret.
 *
 * Note what this email deliberately does NOT contain: a sign-in link. Access
 * still runs through /login, which mails a single-use link only to an address
 * on the allowlist. This is an announcement, not a credential.
